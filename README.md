# Contraband.gg
## A simple, small League of Legends data interface like op.gg: allowing users to see information about their match history, champ mastery, and their ranks.
> Note: In no way am I trying to copy op.gg, I'm trying to merely learn how to create applications by looking to other examples for inspiration.
## The app is available [here](https://contrabandgg.herokuapp.com/)


In order to make this application, I utilized [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to not only make a user interface, but make serverside API calls to the Riot API. To host this website, I used [Heroku](www.heroku.com
) (as seen in the domain name).

> Final note: If the website won't load any data, it's most likely because of an expired API Key. With using Riot Games's API, I use a development key that must be updated every 24hrs. (I'll try to apply for a better key, but no guarantees).
